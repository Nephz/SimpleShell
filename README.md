# Simple-Shell

#### Hello
This was made for fun. \
Primarily inspired by https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/. \
You should use the '-lreadline' flag when compiling with gcc.

NOTE: The piping mechanism that is implemented atm. is not complete - don't use it...


#### Future features

* Command history.
* piping (and redirection?).
* ..?
